# Work-With-OAuth2.0-
This is sample application to demonstrate the OAuth2.0 message flow. This a web application developed by C# ASP.net to upload files to google drive. In this web application, you would have a link where user would get redirected to google and the application would obtain an OAuth access token from google (after user authentication with google). Then your application would provide a browse button where user could select the file to upload and it would be automatically uploaded to the google drive of the user. For uploading the file, your application would use the OAuth access token obtained and call the google APIs
